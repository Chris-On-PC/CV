\CVSection{Hobbies \& Interests}
From an early age, I have always loved to analyze, dismantle and tinker with all kinds of gadgets and gizmos. The majority of my free time is spent exploring the latest tech that I can get my hands on or delving into a new piece of software that could open up exciting opportunities. Another passion of mine is traveling. As a curious mind, I am extremely captivated by what lies across the horizon, whether it be vast landscapes, interesting foods or a unique philosophy to live by. I am also a strong believer in learning new things through engaging with new cultures and working in different environments. At the end of a long day of eager learning, there is nothing quite as relaxing as indulging in the latest digital entertainment or spending quality time with friends and family.
